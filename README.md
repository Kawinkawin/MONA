## Secure Multi-Owner Data Sharing for Dynamic Groups in the Cloud

This project focuses on enabling secure data sharing among dynamic groups in cloud environments, supporting multi-owner control. It ensures that data can be shared securely and efficiently between multiple owners within a cloud infrastructure.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend:**
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript

- **Backend:**
  - Java
  - SQL
  - Tomcat Server (for development)
  - GlassFish Server (for deployment)

- **Cloud Platform:**

### Project Description

This application is designed to facilitate secure data sharing in cloud environments where multiple users and groups dynamically interact. Key features include:

1. **Multi-Owner Control:**
   - Multiple users can manage and control data access permissions.
   - Ensures that data ownership is not confined to a single entity, enhancing collaborative work.

2. **Dynamic Group Management:**
   - Groups can be created, modified, and deleted dynamically.
   - Allows users to join or leave groups seamlessly, with automatic updates to access controls.

3. **Secure Data Sharing:**
   - Implements robust security measures to protect data during transfer and storage.
   - Uses encryption and access control mechanisms to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

4. **Scalable Architecture:**
   - Designed to handle increasing data loads and user numbers.
   - Utilizes cloud infrastructure to provide high availability and reliability.
